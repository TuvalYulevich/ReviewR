App Description –

The main goal of our application is to simplify the way people check and search for ‘reviews’ in their locations area.
Today there are plenty of apps and platforms to look for recommendations, reviews or disses in your near-by area, but all of them suffer from the same issue – They present too much information for the user, and they don’t keep things simple and ‘straight to business’. There are too many steps and stages that the users have to go through before acquiring the information they are looking for – and that’s without talking about the complexity of the way the information is being presented sometimes.
